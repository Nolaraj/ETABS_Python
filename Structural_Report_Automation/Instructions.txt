1. Following files should be provided prior to running of Code(Manually)
	i. {{Architectural_Sectional}} -> i.e Architectural Sectional.pdf file or Architectural Sectional 1.jpg
	ii. {{Groundfloor_Plan}} -> i.e Groundfloor Plan.pdf file or Groundfloor Plan 1.jpg
	iii. {{Model_Participation_1}} -> i.e. Model Participation.pdf or Model Participation 1.jpg
	iv. {{Column_Design_1}}  {{Beam_Design_1}} {{Shearwall_Design_1}} -> i.e Column Design.pdf,
	 Beam Design.pdf and Shearwall Design.pdf or Column Design 1.jpg (OR Column Design 2.jpg...),
	 Beam Design 1.jpg (OR Beam Design 2.jpg...) and Shearwall Design 1.jpg (OR Shearwall Design 2.jpg...).
2. Design File.xlsx must be opened before executing the code (To extract file from them).
3. The text with text colour RED on sheets should be written accordingly in Design File.xlsx and should be
	saved without closing.
4. Screen active time should be made according to the run time.



Further Development
-> ETABS icons should be replaced by assigning appropriate shortcuts to them from etabs.
	from right click on any blank region near toolbar>Customize> Keyboard>Key ASSign OK
-> Images should be cropped upto point where they find any pixel of colour other than white, from 4 sides.
-> Special algorithm should be developed to extract design details, and other files as mentioned in i, ii, iii, iv
	above.
-> Sorting the items (Images in dict) inside list according to the last number of their name (excluding *.jpg)

Process of use
1. Open the project. (Or final product folder and open all 4 *.py files)
2. Install all required modules and other extensions as mentioned below:

3. Open MASTER.py file and run it for i. Data Extraction , ii. Data Processing and iii. Data writing, which 
	can be done through running the functions below the corresponding heading.
